For this assingment, I have enhanced my shell so that it can handle background and foreground processes and handle signals sent to them. It can also to handle input/output redirections and pipes.
`main.c` contains the code for the display of the shell and all of the implemented functions.
PLEASE USE *gcc main.c* to compile the code and *./a.out* to run it. 

NOTE: Ideal to run it on Linux
